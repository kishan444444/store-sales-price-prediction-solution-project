# Store Sales Price Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains a solution for predicting sales prices for a retail store. Using machine learning algorithms, this model predicts the price of products based on various features such as product category, demand, historical sales data, and other relevant factors.

The project focuses on building a predictive model that can accurately forecast the prices of items in a store, helping retailers optimize their pricing strategy, improve inventory management, and increase revenue.

## Features

- **Sales Price Prediction**: Predict the price of items based on historical sales data and features such as product category, demand, and seasonal trends.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data for model training.
- **Model Training**: Various machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks) are used for prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error), etc.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Fine-tune the model to achieve optimal performance.
- **Prediction API**: Expose the trained model via an API to integrate with other applications (Flask or FastAPI).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- XGBoost (if used)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- Flask/FastAPI (for exposing model as an API)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/store-sales-price-prediction.git
   cd store-sales-price-prediction
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:

- **Product ID**: Unique identifier for each product.
- **Category**: Category of the product (e.g., electronics, clothing).
- **Sales**: Historical sales data.
- **Demand**: Demand metric based on previous sales.
- **Seasonality**: Indicator of seasonality (e.g., holiday season, summer, winter).
- **Store Location**: Location of the store (if applicable).
- **Price**: The target variable (sales price).

You can either use your own dataset or the one provided in this repository. The dataset should be formatted as a CSV file with the columns mentioned above.

## Usage

1. **Training the Model**:
   
   To train the model, simply run the following script:

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

   This will train the model using the provided dataset and output the model's performance metrics.

2. **Prediction**:
   
   To make predictions for new data, use the following script:

   ```bash
   python predict.py --input data/input_file.csv
   ```

   The predictions will be saved in `output_predictions.csv`.

3. **API for Predictions**:

   To expose the trained model via an API, run the following command:

   ```bash
   python api.py
   ```

   This will start a Flask/FastAPI server where you can send a POST request with product data to get predicted prices.

## Evaluation Metrics

The model performance is evaluated based on the following metrics:

- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R-Squared (RÂ²)**

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more advanced time-series models for better seasonal prediction.
- Expand the dataset to include more diverse features like customer demographics or competitor pricing.
- Deploy the model as a cloud-based service for real-time predictions.
